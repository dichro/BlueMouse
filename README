Overview
========

BlueMouse is an android app that lets your mobile phone act like 
a bluetooth GPS mouse. It creates and serial bluetooth channelon port 1
and listens for incoming connections. If a client connects it will send out
NMEA GGA and RMC sentences.

The main motivation for this app was to create an app
that can provide GPS data to the foolography unleashed products.
More information can be found on the foolography homepage

Instuctions for foolography unleashed
=====================================

Start the BlueMouse app and try to pair you unleashed with the phone
with the paring code 0000. The first pairing try will usually fail,
because the unleashed doesn't wait long enough for you entering the code.
But the second time you shouldn't get asked for a paring code anymore
and the unleashed device should immediately connect.
